### Simple List Comprehension
print("List comprehension result:")

# The following list comprehension compacts several linesÂ 
# of code into one line:
print([x*2 for x in range(1,11)])

### Long form for loop
print("Long form code result:")

# The list comprehension above accomplishes the same result as
# the long form version of the code shown below:
my_list = []
for x in range(1,11):
    my_list.append(x*2)
print(my_list)


print("List comprehension result:")
print([x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0])

# The list comprehension above accomplishes the same result as
# the long form version of the code:
print("Long form code result:")
my_list = []
for x in range(1,101):
    if x % 10 == 0:
        my_list.append(x)
print(my_list)


# Convert a list to a tuple
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)

print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Remember that although parentheses are often used to define a tuple, 
# they're not always necessary. The following syntax is also valid:

my_tuple = 1, 2, 3, 4
print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, 3, 4)
